Cartoon and Logo Design are a nice expression of minimalism. It is a fun way to express a message. There are no limits to the imagination.

THE NEW COLD WAR IS A VIRUS THREAT
CORONA 2020
Here is the text version for the Reader, and below with images

Images are shot and edited with the Iphone 13, even the text overlay including typo.

Mist surrounds the land. It is a cold night below zero degrees. Darkness takes place. Humanity is no more what it was. They have their new toy on the sleeve. It was terrorists, and before the Soviet Union, with the atomic cold war threat. Now its a virus.

I can not join the restaurant anymore. The enemy is me, and treated like animals, i can not socialize with friends since i got no g's. Is that racism?

But people have forgotten. Before it was witches and native tribes.

Even the animals don't understand what happen with humans.

The moon is full and behind the mist, but humanity still stuck into darkness. People have forgotten, every day half a dozen of animal species go extinct.

Even in the beautiful wood one find little temples with a sacrificial table. Obvious but people forget. Rich people become richer and always get away with it, like the Nazis. Tell me Legolas, when do we let evil become stronger than us.

In the second war the Germans lost the war but the Nazis won. They were evacuated in the last three weeks before the war was over, with Operation Paperclip and Odessa.

Paperclip was, USA working with the Vatican and Red Cross. Only scientists like Wernher von Braun were would not need to hide the Identity, to demonstrate the power. Nazi war lords where given false identities in Spain and after more than a year, went off to Argentina or somewhere else.

The public media does spread fear. Then the sheeples will declare others as a threat. This is powerful propaganda technology.

National Socialism is working that way. People against people.

This is how they separate the people by force the people to hate each other, instead of respect every other. The majority will obey. Simple game.

How many mutations will they relase. Maybe only until the water shortage will come, wich sis primed for 20 years. Thats before you must pay for breathing air. Then only a Life on Mars will buy rich people out, of misery. Revelation says the whore o Babylon with red hair. The new tool has a name. It's called Neuralink. If you think that I am a paranoid freak, then the national socialism works on you. Wake Up The Time Is Now! Switch of the propaganda media brainwash. We are not the enemies, and never were nor will be! susilogic 2020 Philipp Wyler

THE NEW COLD WAR IS AGAIN NUCLEAR IN 2022
VISION 2012
Here is the text version for the Reader, and below the image

Vector design ipad 2 - Inkpad app.

On the background is far away planet Earth. In the foreground, a small sportive car-like flying saucer came to halt, for read the warning signs. On the fore seat a Zeta Reticuli Alien holding the steering wheel, and on the back seat is his Alien wife and the Alien cat. They are on the Jurney to have some holidays but did not chosen yet where, because they will find a beautiful planet, and decide to stay there for Camping.

On the left side of the image is a tiny planet three times smaller than their saucer. On it are the warning signs, which are visible from far away, to warn all visitors. A Flower and her Ant live there, and are the best friends ever.

The signs has a huge nuclear hazard warning, with text below:

"Danger, Hazardous Humanoids".

On the frontside a second sign has the death warning, with the Scull and four bones but from alien nature, so everyone can understand without Language.

Mrs Alien saying: "Oh, look, those morons are still using the forbidden chain reaction."

Mr Alien saying: "Oh my God, the Kids have found the matches!"

The Cat says: "Don't worry, that's the short shit."

Flower and Ant are giving them an example, but it is in Ur Language.
