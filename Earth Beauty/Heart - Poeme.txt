The Seed Of Life
ALPHA AND OMEGA CREATION
The Glands are the main source of Hormones,
and the Hormones are the main source of the Brain,
and the Brain is the main source of the Soul,
and the Soul is the main source of the Spirit,
and the Spirit is the main source of the God,
and the God is the main source of the Universe,
and the Universe is the main source of the Alpha Intelligence.
