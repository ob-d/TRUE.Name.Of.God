PROJECT LOOKING GLASS
The Time topic seems to most difficult for me, since there is no information at all, and I have no visible image yet, to explain it.

Therefore, the Quantum mechanics, that make all this possible, is fully described in all relations at the Quantum computer chapter, which seems a bit sad, but in reality, there is good news in there!

The only sad things are belonging to the past, and are only for us, to never ever ever ever forget again, the game of 1% Vs 99% that now has come to an End.

As usual there is facts about this subject, so let us see what we can find.

Question: "But how can it be that 1% is so smart and can fool the other 99% completely?"

Answer: "This is a good Question and the Answer is not easy to make, since there is different technologies in use."

Question: "What do you mean with different technologies, I can not understand?"

Answer: "Yes, that is the point where it It gets pretty much like science fiction, as it could not get better.
In other words, this is The best Top most kept Secret, they have hidden from us, and you already know about the exception."

Question: "Exception, what do you mean, from the secrecy?"

Answer: "Yea, the exception, you know the ones not buying it, and be burned as a witch or be hanged as heretic, crucified, stoned to death, declared insane and stuffed with chemistry and electroshocks.
That was the exceptions.
It is so fancy and scientific nerd stuff, while the sad history as the dark spot, I really hesitate for days to write the final chapter to complete the first release.
This subject is mind bending, so let us begin on where we know some facts about these topics.

Now the second topic will be a Top Secret Underground Black Project of USA.
Project Looking Glass and Phil Corso
It is the only official Country, where some whistle blowers would shed light into the darkness of their Top secret underground projects.

But first let's dig in the history, where the people made a fire in the stove, perhaps it is more familiar with us."

Question: "How in the world of logic, could they foresee the future with technology, that did not existed for another 1973 Years."

Answer: "Well maybe we are thinking completely wrong on this subject of how they lived in the past before electricity and internet.
This one is very very very simple to Answer indeed.
Only problem, to answer this simple question first two other basic layers must be understood.
Let me pose you a Question, first and bring the answer, and otherwise just go back to eat your juicy steak and be your rock star, no one would mind."

Question: "Is the: I think so I am, local in our brain only, or is there something non local to it like a Soul or Spirit, that can live without physical Body?"

Answer: "Yes this is a proven fact nowadays, since a percentage of people had the Near-death experience, but hesitate to speak about it.
As I already said, you would be crucified and burned if you do so.
This is now fact and since we are talking about a percentage, means that at least 1 out of 100 humans had this Near-death experience, where a portion saw Angels or even God.
Good. We have something non local and we are Not just our brain and only live 80-90 Years at average.

No no no. Not."

Question: What do you mean, not?"

Imagine Fritz is now in the Surgery and declared brain dead for 12 minutes, before the magic happens and Fritz has heartbeat again and is back to life.
Yea that is what a usual Near-death experience looks like, in this 12 minutes Fritz is flying around and looking at the doctors and nurses from above.

Question: "Shure but what do you think happen, if we take the sharpest Sabre and try to cut Fritz flying there, in pieces to kill him?"

Answer: "Nothing happens you can not kill the non material body system, which is the: I think so I am."

Antwort: "Es passiert nichts, man kann das nicht-materielle Körpersystem nicht töten, das ist das: Ich denke, also bin ich."
