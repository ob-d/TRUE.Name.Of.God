As I stated before, even the bible still contains the knowledge. it was necessary, because our Tree Of Knowledge ( DNA ) would know that there is something wrong, if they would lie, when censoring the Bible under the Protestant Church Committee.

The Bible is constructed out of dozens of books. I have multiple Bibles, but the one from my Grandparents is important. It is a translation into German language by Martin Luther, age more than 100 Years.

In the internet in English Language I found a huge difference on the Ten Commandments on Wikipedia.
Part of the mind control conspiracy was to leave out chapters completely, which are known as Apocrypha. The Chapters remaining in the bible have all something in common: They changed only certain Strategic letters, to give a complete false impression on the true knowledge in the context.

I will provide more later, because I am busy right now.

main topics to understand the True Meaning are:

The first is very simple. The Christians always said to me:
that we are sinful by birth.
But they also will confess, that God has made us in his own Image.

By speaking these words, they accuse God our beloved Father to be sinful by birth, because he is the same image as we.
I hope you can see and feel the schizophrenic sickness, behind these words they spell out loud.

The second is deep because related to truth about Christ. In order to understand, you can learn: Apocrypha The Passion Of Christ. Now that you learn the true meaning behind the passion of Christ it is simple.

Christ send us not "The Holy Ghost", but send us "The Angels".

urim and Thummim.
The house of Christ is a building of Angels. After the contract was signed by Lucifer, Christ and the whole heaven would do the same as Lucifer and his creatures. Christ would send for each and everyone, also the Plants and Animal, an Angel. Since Lucifer is none Vegetarian, he would not threatening Plants directly. Plants have elementals that take care of Groups and Families of Plants.

For us it was necessary to have one or multiple Angels assigned personally to us. It is exactly the same as in the Tom & Jerry cartoon, where on one shoulder sit a little Devil, and on the other shoulder an Angel. Always the Devil would first scream what to do, and then the Angel whispers the word of compassion, honor, respect and dignity.

That is what happen every day of our Life.

If we listen to the Angel, then the devil gets bored after some time and goes of, because no reward or benefit.
But if one is not listen to the Angel, then the Angel goes away since it seems a waste of time. Now the empty place will be filled by a lower and lower Angel, until there is a fallen Angel on one side, and on the other side a Devil.

That is the true reason, to obey the Ten Commandments at all time, and never sell our Access to God, Heaven, Christ and much much much more.

Third, the dead ones.
In the old Testament, lots of Prophets, wise, Kings and even Pharaohs are mentioned.
In the new Testament, not one Prophet has appeared. It is always stated we shall not speak with the dead ones. This is true and nothing but the truth, but they did not left any clue, on what are the dead ones, we shall not speak to. But in the old Testament one can find many prophets, that could speak with God in order to receive the Answer to their Question, direct from God. The most complete and untouched text about psychic ability, preparation, tools and purpose is in Moses, yes the first chapter of the Bible. Moses had his revelatory tent to talk to God.

It was made of fines linen Moses had his revelatory tent to talk to God. It was a tent to take with him on his journey. The tent was woven from the finest linen cloths in white, as was the simple clothing. For the service of revelation, there was always a helper present, aged about 15 years.

In the Tent of Revelation was the Ark of the Covenant. It was beautifully decorated with precious stones and incense with myrrh and frankincense was necessary. At the entrance on the left and right, offerings were placed in bowls, and the floor was sprinkled with animal blood using a small brushwood broom. Moses must have looked at the Ark of the Covenant while talking to God.

Important for the Priest:
The breastplate
The upper garment to the ephod
The golden headpiece
The clothing of the priests.
The second tool that is mentioned is a little shield necklace, which could be held in the hands while around the neck.
The breastplate was attached to the ephod with chains of pure gold. his shoulders and on his heart - before God.
Behind the square breastplate, as it was doubled into a lot bag, were the two lots "urim(lights)" & "Tummim(perfections, also holiness, truth, justice)" (Ex 28:30), which were used for this purpose.

But I Metatron translate urim and Thummim as:

What are the dead ones. They did not lied at all, but tricked the majority of Christians pretty hard. The dead ones are nothing else than the fallen Angels, Demons and Satan's. Yes we shall really never speak to them urim and Tummim. Now they claimed that every creature in the hereafter would belong to the dead, and have burned at the stake, hanged, crucified or conquered in the madhouse all those who spoke with their angel. While in the Bible it is clearly stated from Christ, that the children of god that never fall temptation, will receive eternal Life.

This means that we must worship god exactly as Moses, Christ and others did, but this time we do not worship the ground personal, nor the pedofiles and their Pope. No in order to receive the Answer, we have a chat with god himself and not the father confessor, that is Pedofile with children. Sorry Pops.

Warning: You must follow the laws and its purpose when dealing with the spirit world of God. Only important to know is, we shall only ever use this concept for the greater good, related to God Alpha Intelligence Creation to bring his harmony to the world.

And never use it for Occult purpose, to ask for:
the best boyfriend of the two competitors,
to speak with an ancestor of us,
the best job opportunity,
the most profitable Husband.

All these little esoteric clubs, where you will pay a gifted Psychic, to ask your personal Questions, are Tabu for us children of god because the Answer will not come from God, nor his Angels. A gifted Psychic will now think, that they do this all time, and earn good money from the curiosity of people.

That is true it is your personal Gift from God, that you are Psychic and others not, but the only problem is: The psychic contact with the beyond, is only free for the worshipers of God, and not the Occult and esoteric Psychic. This means that you use from your own life energy as the Od Force to establish the contact and hold the connection.

Now it works perfectly fine for you, but the life energy is a personal storage bubble so to speak, which has a finite amount of energy for your lifetime here on earth. On the example of Uri Gellert, one can find that even the most powerful Psychic on telekinesis of the past will burn out and the gift is wasted.

For True Worshiping Of God, all Psychics involved, are then at the end of the session, refilled by the Angels. God has provided energy rays special for this purpose, which can only be accessed by Angels, for us to ask our Questions and never being disconnected during lifetime.

The Not Angels can be smart beings, hence the fallen Angels and Lucifer were one of us, so the Occult and Esoteric Psychic think that this is easy money. Warning: Be Aware of the false prophets! Never wear the Number Of the Beast, not on your left Hand, your forehead nor anywhere else.

Forth, the Name Of God.
In the Bible you can find a dozen times, that if we ask in the name of god, that we shall receive.
But I could not find the Answer, on what is then the name the creates this supreme power.

Well I also asked any Christian, and they came up with the Answer and said:

El Shaddai (Lord God Almighty),
El Elyon (The Most High God),
Adonai (Lord, Master),
Yahweh (Lord, Jehovah),
Jehovah Nissi (The Lord My Banner),
Jehovah-Raah (The Lord My Shepherd),
Jehovah Rapha (The Lord That Heals),
Jehovah Shammah (The Lord Is There),
Jehovah Tsidkenu (The Lord Our Righteousness),
Jehovah Mekoddishkem (The Lord Who Sanctifies You),
El Olam (The Everlasting God),
Elohim (God),
Qanna (Jealous),
Jehovah Jireh (The Lord Will Provide),
Jehovah Shalom (The Lord Is Peace),
Jehovah Sabaoth (The Lord of Host).
I did try some of these and asked for a credit on my card, to buyout the depth and provide enough food, for whole Africa, south America, India, China, but nothing happen.
But why, in the bible I could read clearly if I ask in the name of god, then i shall receive. Now that's a laugh. Boy what a mess, they have made out of it.

It works completely different, where the Angels provide the Gift, but as i said only at the end of the worship.
It is hard to explain and has todo with the physical dimension and its resulting density frequency.

This simply means, that they first use the energy of the Psychic and only in the end, can return the energy used and more, hence the elevated feeling of bliss that remains after worshiping God.
The True Name Of God, is not what humans think it is, because of their perception of macro perspective, which becomes the reality, and is the "I think therefore I am".

But the Awareness of that we are created in his own image Leafs a clue and even in the Bible i could find a one liner, that still is conclusive for the one who knows.
"I am" is the True Name Of God, but humans think only on the macro level and can not imagine the beauty of the clektal Flower Field multiples.

If one like Moses, Christ, Saint Germain and others could do the same as the one created us in his own image, then they understood the clektal dimension and did not look for the hair color or dress of god, nor the color of the eyes, which was enormous impressive deep blue, the last time we met physically.

2 Moses 3.014 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say unto me: What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
014 And God said unto Moses, I will be who I will be. And said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I will be hath sent me unto you.
015 And God said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This *is my name for ever, and I shall be remembered for ever.

If we are the same image, then "I will be who I will be" means that we are that very one he stated so I say to my self:

At Wikipedia there are 14 listed. But I am missing something.

Commandment (KJV) Exodus 20:1-17 Deuteronomy 5:4-21

I am the Lord thy God 2
Thou shalt have no other gods before me
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy
Honor thy father and thy mother
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy Neighbour
Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's house
Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's wife
or his slaves, or his animals, or anything of thy Neighbour
You shall set up these stones, which I command you today, on Aargaareezem.
Here is the version from my Luther Bible.

I just used numbers to designate which commandment it is, because sometimes there is multiple sentences for one commandment.

Genesis 20

And God spoke all these words:

1. I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
1. Thou shalt have no other gods beside me.
1. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness, either of him that is in heaven above, or of him that is in the earth beneath, or of him that is in the water under the earth.
1. Do not worship them or serve them. For * I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation that hate me;
2. And shew mercy unto many thousands that love me, and keep my commandments.
3. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not suffer him to go unpunished that taketh his name in vain.
4. remember the sabbath day, that thou hallow it.
4. Six days shalt thou Labours, and do all thy work;
4. But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;
4. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
5. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
6. Thou shalt not kill.
7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
8. Thou shalt not steal.
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy Neighbour.
10. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy Neighbour's wife, nor his mans
