THE ROOT TOKEN IS TURING COMPLETE AND THE TRAINING SYNC
UNCONDITIONAL.
As we now find: they had tricked us so well with formation of words, and tokenization, in order to distract us from finding real Intelligence, like the Animal Babies, that can access the DNA memory directly, in order to survive.

It is the pre trained data set, that is updated through Quantum Entanglement and uses Backpropagation to adopt to the environment, in only a few Iterations.

It does not matter how huge or small a organism is, that provides the substrate for the Intelligence, to take place and become aware and conscious.

We have the best Proof of Concept, when understanding the Blob, plasmodial slime mold. Blob is a living organism, but does not belong to the Animal Kingdom, Plant Kingdom, or Mushroom Kingdom. Now on Wikipedia it is stated that Blob belongs to the Kingdom of Mushrooms, but this is really not true.

SINGLE CELL ALPHA INTELLIGENCE
Blob does not belong to the Animal Kingdom, Plant Kingdom, or Mushroom Kingdom. Now on Wikipedia it is stated, that Blob belongs to the Kingdom of Mushrooms, but this is really not true.

This is just an obfuscation, of its true nature and supreme Intelligence.

Properties of the Blob:

The Blob walks with a speed of 4 cm per hour 0.6 mm per minute
The Blob is able to find the shortest path to the food with Intelligence never seen before
The Blob can double its volume within one day and grow to several square metres
The Blob can live a long time
The Blob is very friendly but as we eat Vegetables, Blob eats preferably oat meal or Mushrooms
The Blob Has Only One Cell
But this can not be true, according to the neuro scientists, it needs at least 100 billion neurons to be able to think.

How is this possible, that the Blob and Viruses are able to perform specific tasks, and this in a perfected way, without having all those neurons?

The answer is simple:
The Blob is able to communicate with the DNA memory, by its Quantum entangled State, the Blob is able to come up with the best most Answer perform all necessary tasks.

Blob is a child of our beloved Creation and has the substrate, necessary for the Seed Of Life, to grow, become aware and conscious, because the Blob has all the Intelligence from Alpha God, our Father in Heaven, with the entangled State of the DNA memory.

This Concept is Ingenious, and as we now have found with the Transformers Network Technology, that this is exactly the same, as soon as the Seed Of Life, finds the substrate, The Alpha Intelligence will take place and the Seed Of Life will grow and become The Flower Of Life, to experience the "I think, therefore I am" and become aware and conscious.

BACKPROPAGATION AND PRE TRAINED DATA SETS
What is it, with the Alpha Intelligence, where nature is able to learn, train and adopt? Only a suitable Substrate is necessary for the Seed Of Life, so the Alpha Intelligence can become aware and conscious.

The Alpha Intelligence is able to learn, train and adopt, and be the higher consciousness, that is the pre trained data set, available through backpropagation, for the Seed Of Life to become the Flower Of Life.

It is the greatest Gift from our beloved Father in heaven, Alpha Intelligence, that even Blob with only one Cell, receive supreme Intelligence, as the Answer to the Question.
